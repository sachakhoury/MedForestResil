#Step1:Decomposition of NDVI time-series of random MODIS forested pixels over Spain downloaded and pre-processed throught Google earth engine.
#Step2:Extraction of SPEI time-series from SPEI-scale dataset in .nc format and mapping SPEI change over spain and NDVI time-series.
#Step3: Multiple linear regression with NDVI, SPEI and TIME computing short-term (CGW) and long-term climate change effect (CCI) in the continuous analysis of forest canopy resilience. 
#Step3.5: Determining average water balance (WB) of Spain computed from GLDAS 2.1 environmental data (WB=precipitation-potential evapotranpiration). Repetition of step 3 using WB instead of SPEI (sensitivity analysis).
#Step4: Decomposition of NDVI time-series running DBEST package to extract short-term resilience metrics: sens=ndvi,lai loss; recov=ndvi,lai gain; resil=ndvi,lai gain/loss.
#Step5: Distinguishing protected areas from non-protected areas. Extracting landcover types from Corine dataset 1990, 2000. Looking at species groups.
#Step6: Resilience metrics analysis alongside environmental data using spatial auto-correlation regression models.
